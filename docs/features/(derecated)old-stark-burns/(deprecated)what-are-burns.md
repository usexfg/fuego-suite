## Overview

HEAT is a cross-chain token earned by permanently locking XFG in a special commitment called a burn deposit. Unlike a regular CD, a burn deposit has no maturity date — the XFG is locked forever.

After burning, you generate a zero-knowledge proof (STARK proof) that demonstrates your burn is valid without revealing your identity. You submit this proof to an EVM contract (on Ethereum or Arbitrum) to claim HEAT tokens. Fuego's ZK bridge trustlessly verifies your Fuego deposit on Ethereum.

<Warning>
  Burning XFG is permanent and irrevocable. There is no unlock path, no maturity height, and no protocol mechanism to retrieve burned XFG. Only burn what you are certain you will not need.

## HEAT vs LP pool — they are different systems

A common point of confusion:

| | HEAT burns | LP swap pool |
|--|------------|-------------|
| What you put in | XFG (permanently) | XFG (retrievable) |
| What you earn | HEAT tokens (off-chain) | 0.3% swap fees (on-chain) |
| Proof required | STARK proof (trustless Ethereum claim) | None |
| Lockup | Permanent | Flexible |
| Decoy pool | Shared via `0xD5` unified marker | On-chain liquidity |

Both systems are essential but serve different purposes. Notably, both HEAT and CD deposits (like those in the LP pool) write a single unified `0xD5` tag into `tx_extra`. This encrypts their deposit type, making HEAT burns and CD deposits indistinguishable on-chain, and feeding them into the same commitment decoy pool.

## Why burn XFG

Burning reduces the circulating supply of XFG permanently. If swap volume (and thus CD yield) grows, early burn participants earn HEAT tokens.

This is speculative. The value of HEAT tokens depends entirely on adoption and is not guaranteed by the Fuego protocol.
